# Hodgkin-Huxley-model
This repository contains a report that explains the concept of the HH model in detail and has a code file for the simulation of the spiky potential generation of the model

You can find the detailed report on the Hodgkin-Huxley model, including its equations and underlying mathematics, [here](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Hodgkin-Huxley-model/blob/main/Hodgkin_Huxley.pdf). This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the model's role in generating spiky action potentials.

The code simulation of the model contains 3 files:-
- <u>[Parameter file](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Hodgkin-Huxley-model/blob/main/parameters.yaml) </u> -- This file contains all the parameter values used in the model. To know more about the parameters and their significance, please refer to the report.

- <u>[Python file](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Hodgkin-Huxley-model/blob/main/hh_file.py) </u> -- This file contains the OOP code of the model, Please refer this file for all the equations used in the model.

- <u>[Execution file](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Hodgkin-Huxley-model/blob/main/main.ipynb)</u> -- This file is for the model simulation, this file contains four result plots, of Voltage and gating variables.
