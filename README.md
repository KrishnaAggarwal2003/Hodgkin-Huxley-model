# Hodgkin-Huxley-model
This repository contains a report that explains the concept of the HH model in detail and has a code file for the simulation of the spiky potential generation of the model

You can find the detailed report on the Hodgkin-Huxley model, including its equations and underlying mathematics, [here](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Hodgkin-Huxley-model/blob/main/Hodgkin_Huxley.pdf). This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the model's role in generating spiky action potentials.

The code simulation of the model contains 3 files:-
